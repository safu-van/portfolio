              Hello! My name is <strong>Mohamed Safuvan</strong>. As a

              My journey into the world of technology began, After completing my
              Plus Two education, I chose a different path. Instead of pursuing
              a college degree, I dedicated over a year to mastering
              cutting-edge programming technologies and tools. This intense
              learning experience equipped me with practical skills that rival
              or even exceed those of many computer science graduates.
